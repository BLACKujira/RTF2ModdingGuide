- Stages with ID 243 and beyond do not lead to actual stages, but instead open specific interfaces.
- If the stage has finished loading but the black screen isn't manually faded, you can locate the runtime object `FadeDriver` to `UMG_Fade_C`, then call `SetAlpha` to remove the black screen.
- If the stage doesn't end the loading screen automatically, you can call `Bp_StageLoader_C`'s `RequestLoadScreenOff` to end the loading, and you will likely need to manually remove the black screen.

# Backup Save Files

If you want to restore your save after experiencing mod content, or are concerned about potential save corruption, it's recommended to back up your game save beforehand so you can restore it when needed.

## Locate Save File

Usually, the game's save files are stored in  
`C:\Users\{YourUsername}\Saved Games\RTypeFinal2\Saved\SaveGames\`  
Replace `{YourUsername}` with the username you use to play *RTypeFinal2* on your system.

- Depending on your system version and language, `Users` and `Saved Games` might appear as their localized names, such as `ユーザー` and `保存的游戏`.

- You can also directly navigate to the save folder by entering  
`%USERPROFILE%\Saved Games\RTypeFinal2\Saved\SaveGames\`  
in the address bar of File Explorer.

## Copy Save Files

The file `SLOT00.sav` is your main game save file. Backing up this file is usually sufficient. Files like `ALBUM000.sav` are ship saves from the R Album, and files like `ALBUM000THUMB.sav` are their corresponding thumbnails.

To back up, just copy `SLOT00.sav`. When restoring a save, make sure to **close the game** and then replace the current `SLOT00.sav` with your backup.

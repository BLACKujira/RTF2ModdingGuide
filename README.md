## Chapter 4.1: PAK Mods
*PAK Mods* are a superset of Blueprint Mods. They typically do not extend the game system's functionality. There are two types: 
1. PAK Mods that do not require baking, created using *UAssetGUI* and *UnrealPak*, often for data modification.
2. PAK Mods that require baking, created using *Unreal Engine*, typically for replacing music or textures.

- Example: Replacing Background Music (requires baking)
- Example: Modifying Weapon Data (does not require baking)

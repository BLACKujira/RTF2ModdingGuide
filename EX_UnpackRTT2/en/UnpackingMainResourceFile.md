# Unpacking Main Resource File

## Extracting Disc Contents

If you have a game disc and your computer still has a CD/DVD drive, you can directly copy the files from the disc to your local storage.

If you don't have a CD drive, you can use the game's disc image file (e.g., .ISO) and extract the contents in the following ways:

- Mount the disc image using your operating system's built-in functionality.
- Open and extract the contents using compression software like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
- Use a virtual drive tool.

## Running the Extraction Script

1. Navigate to the following directory in the disc file structure: `PSP_GAME\USRDIR\CMN`
2. Find and note the full paths of these two files:
   - CMN.DAT (about 756MB)
   - CMN.FAT

3. Set up your Python environment and download the extraction script (`extract_rtt2_dat.py`) from [Releases](https://github.com/BLACKujira/RTF2ModdingGuide/releases)

4. Open the `extract_rtt2_dat.py` script file, go to the main program section at the bottom, and modify the following variables:

```python
dat_dir = r"Path to your CMN.DAT"
fat_dir = r"Path to your CMN.FAT"
output_dir = r"Folder where you want to output the files"
```

After successful execution, the output directory will contain numerous subfolders and uppercase-named resource files.

## Viewing and Converting Models

1. Download and install Noesis.
2. Use Noesis to open the output directory generated by the script and browse through the resource files.
- .GIM files: Typically texture files.
- .GMO files: These may be model files, animation resources, or unknown file types.
3. Right-click on the resource â†’ Choose `Export` to convert the resource into common formats (e.g., .obj, .fbx, .png).

Note: The model sizes in *R-Type Tactics II* are much smaller compared to *R-Type Final 2*. Before importing them into *R-Type Final 2*, you may need to adjust their sizes using 3D modeling software.

# Exporting Textures Using PPSSPP

If you only need textures and not the models, exporting textures using PPSSPP is a simpler and more intuitive method.

## Steps

1. Open `PPSSPP` and go to the settings menu.
2. Navigate to `Tools` -> `Developer Tools`.
3. Enable `Save new textures`.
4. Run the game and enter a level that contains the textures you want.

The textures from that level will be saved in the `memstick\PSP\TEXTURES\NPJH50119\new` folder inside your PPSSPP directory.

### Note:
One downside of this method is that if the textureâ€™s width and height are not equal, the shorter side will be padded with extra data, so cropping may be necessary.
